# First React Project ‚öõÔ∏è 

This is my first [React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) learning project! This project serves as a hands-on exploration of these technologies as I delve into their functionalities and best practices.


## Features üí°

- **Routing:** Created multi-page navigation with active styling.
- **Usability:** Indicated the active page with a visual style.
- **Responsiveness:** The project is responsive, supporting both mobile and larger screens.
- **Mobile Navigation:** Implemented a hamburger menu in the mobile version.
- **Image Carousel:** Implemented an image carousel on one of the pages, with a dynamic presentation of images.
- **Contact Form:** Created a form on the contact page with a modal that displays user-entered name and email when the form is submitted.
